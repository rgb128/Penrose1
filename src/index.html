				Every Penrose tiling is unique, but determined by just 4 real numbers. It's so easy and so hard. It's so old and so young. It's our life. There is a ton of math behind it, but even a kid can understand it intuitively. It was so boring and so interesting to create it. There are so many and so few tutorials on this. Penrose tiling is full of controversies and is very complete and simple. From a particular point of view, Penrose tiling is our life. And our life is humanity's life. And humanity's life is planets's life. And so on and so on.
